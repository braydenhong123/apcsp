	<p>The image above shows all my classes i took as well as things i did outside of school. Football was a very big part of me and i had a ton of fun playing it and getting better by practicing everyday, it took up a lot of my time and I am very excited to play. The lion in the middle represents the school I go to in Piedmont High School. I spent a lot of time outside exploring and getting away and enjoying my time outside in peace with myself.</p>
